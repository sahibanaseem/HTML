            A school is an important place for an individual to learn. A school teaches the students to learn, write and speak correctly. A school makes a person active in life by teaching various other things than academics. It teaches us moral values and the right discipline in life.

            A school teaches us to face the challenges thrown by life. My School does the same thing as any other school would do. The name of my school is Delhi Public School. The building of my school is very big and beautiful. There is a big basketball & badminton court, volleyball and football ground in our school.

            For the morning prayer, all the school students gather on the ground and sing the prayer together. My school has a huge library and it has many types of subject books and novels. I never miss any class in school. I go to school regularly and learn new things every day.
